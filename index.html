                <h2>About David</h2>
                    <p> Growing up, I loved computers and technology. Technology has made life easier for society. My passion for technology has grown as I have gotten older
                        and I wanted to pursue this career path. Outside of my current studies as a software engineer, I love to sing and dance. I have performed and opened for
                        numerous events and people and I really enjoy being on stage.
                    </p>
                    <p> As a current student at the University of Colorado Denver, I joined Thinkful to help increase my knowledge of coding and 
                        help create a portfolio for myself. I strive to be a good team player and hard worker in any project that I have lined up for me.
                        I am excited to see what Thinkful has in store for my future.
